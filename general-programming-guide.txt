 Programming Guide :
=====================

===========
 general:
===========

(1) at least Java SDK 1.5 is needed
(2) use whatever IDE you want (I like Eclipse, everything already there..)


===========
 coding:
===========

(1) one BioinfAlgorithm sub class per algorithm to implement
(2) additional classes and thus class files are possible and usually needed,
    think about reusable code and sub problems that can be extracted into 
    reusable classes
(3) create full JavaDoc documentation comment blocks for all classes and members
(4) verbose source code commenting for readable source code and good maintenance
(5) use self-explanatory member names, something like "x","grmpf",.. might be
    short and easy but reduce readablility of the source code
(6) make use of indention to separate code blocks etc.
(7) use YOUR OWN package name (subdir) for your algorithms to cluster your 
    source files!
    e.g. "timtam" could be the package name for participant Tim Taler such that 
    all his class files are in the "timtam" sub folder and accessible via 
    "timtam.AlgorithmClass1", ...  


===========
 source:
===========

(1) have a look at the ExampleAlgorithm
(2) create your own package sub directory in your source folder
(3) create a sub class of BioinfAlgorithm and implement the abstract methods
    according to their JavaDoc description and the ExampleAlgorithm template

(4) to test your implementation: copy, adapt, and use the 2 line main function
    from ExampleAlgorithm and set appropriate default values for your 
    parameters.
    afterwards you can compile and run your class
